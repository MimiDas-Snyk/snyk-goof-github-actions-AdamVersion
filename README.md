Setup Instructions
To enable these workflows in your repository:

Set Up Snyk Token: Add your Snyk API token as a secret named SNYK_TOKEN in your repository's settings.​

Ensure Compatibility: Make sure your project structure matches the expected setup for each workflow (e.g., presence of pom.xml for Maven projects, package.json for npm projects, etc.).​

Customize Workflows: If necessary, modify the workflows to fit your project's specific requirements, such as adjusting the Node.js or Python versions.
