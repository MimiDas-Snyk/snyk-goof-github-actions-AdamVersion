An application which processes untrusted input and passes it directly to `acorn`, will allow attackers to leverage the vulnerability leading to a Denial of Service.\n\n# Details\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\n\nUpgrade `acorn` to version 5.7.4, 6.4.1, 7.1.1 or higher.\n\n\n# References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/commit/793c0e569ed1158672e3a40aeed1d8518832b802)\n\n- [GitHub Issue 6.x Branch](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/issues/929)\n\n- [NPM Security Advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1488)\n"

It could extract files outside the target folder.\n\n# Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `adm-zip` to version 0.5.2 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip/commit/119dcad6599adccc77982feb14a0c7440fa63013)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `braces` to version 2.3.1 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/abdafb0cae1e0c00f184abbadc692f4eaa98f451)\n"

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n## Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n## Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `cookie` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/commit/e10042845354fea83bd8f34af72475eed1dadf5c)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167)\n- [Red Hat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2316549)\n"

When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `cross-spawn` to version 6.0.6, 7.0.5 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/5ff3a07d9add449021d806e45c4168203aa833ff)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/640d391fde65388548601d95abedccc12943374f)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/pull/160)\n"

It is possible to pollute the `blocks` Array attribute of the object `context` within the `compileBlocks` function. This vulnerability can be leveraged for code execution since this property is added to the `compiled` function, which is then executed by the `VM` module.\r\n\r\n# PoC\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst dust = require('dustjs-linkedin');\r\n\r\n\r\nlet cmd = \"this.constructor.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('curl 127.0.0.1')\"\r\nObject.prototype.ANY_CODE= [cmd];\r\nconst compiled = dust.compile(`{username} is a valid Dust reference.{~n}`);\r\nconst tmpl = dust.loadSource(compiled);\r\ndust.render(tmpl, { username: \"byc_404\" }, (err, out) => {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    console.log(out);\r\n});\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n## For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `dustjs-linkedin` to version 3.0.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c6rp-wrp9-qr4q)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/pull/805/commits/ddb6523832465d38c9d80189e9de60519ac307c3)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/issues/804)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/pull/805)\n"

The only difference being that `render` expects a string to be used for the template and `renderFile` expects a path to a template file.\r\n\r\nBoth functions can be invoked in two ways. The first is calling them with `template`, `data`, and `options`:\r\n```js\r\nejs.render(str, data, options);\r\n\r\nejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, callback)\r\n```\r\nThe second way would be by calling only the `template` and `data`, while `ejs` lets the `options` be passed as part of the `data`:\r\n```js\r\nejs.render(str, dataAndOptions);\r\n\r\nejs.renderFile(filename, dataAndOptions, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf used with a variable list supplied by the user (e.g. by reading it from the URI with `qs` or equivalent), an attacker can control `ejs` options. This includes the `root` option, which allows changing the project root for includes with an absolute path.  \r\n\r\n```js\r\nejs.renderFile('my-template', {root:'/bad/root/'}, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy passing along the root directive in the line above, any includes would now be pulled from `/bad/root` instead of the path intended. This allows the attacker to take control of the root directory for included scripts and divert it to a library under his control, thus leading to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe [fix](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6) introduced in version `2.5.3` blacklisted `root` options from options passed via the `data` object.\r\n\r\n# Disclosure Timeline\r\n- November 27th, 2016 - Reported the issue to package owner.\r\n- November 27th, 2016 - Issue acknowledged by package owner.\r\n- November 28th, 2016 - Issue fixed and version `2.5.3` released.\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nThe vulnerability can be resolved by either using the GitHub integration to [generate a pull-request](https://snyk.io/org/projects) from your dashboard or by running `snyk wizard` from the command-line interface.\r\nOtherwise, Upgrade `ejs` to version `2.5.3` or higher.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln)\r\n- [Fix commit](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6)"

If the `parseNested` option is enabled, sending a corrupt HTTP request can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker.

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path.

The package's parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing specially-crafted templates, which may allow attackers to exhaust system resources leading to Denial of Service.\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `handlebars` to version 4.4.5 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/8d5530ee2c3ea9f0aee3fde310b9f36887d00b8b)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1579)\n- [NPM Security Advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1300)\n"

This may allow attackers to crash the application or execute Arbitrary Code in specific conditions.\n\n# Details\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\r\n\r\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\r\n    \r\n-   Property definition by path\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\r\n\r\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\r\n```\r\nmerge (target, source)\r\n\r\n  foreach property of source\r\n\r\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\r\n\r\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\r\n\r\n    else\r\n\r\n      target[property] = source[property]\r\n```\r\n<br>  \r\n\r\nWhen the source object contains a property named `_proto_` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\r\n\r\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\r\n\r\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\r\n\r\n## Property definition by path\r\n\r\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\r\n\r\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\r\n\r\n# Types of attacks\r\n\r\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`.

Prototype access to the template engine allows for potential code execution.\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `handlebars` to version 4.6.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/pull/1633)\n- [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/726364)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `hosted-git-info` to version 3.0.8, 2.8.9 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/npm/hosted-git-info/commit/bede0dc38e1785e732bf0a48ba6f81a4a908eba3)\n"

If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with `ini.parse`, they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.\r\n\r\n# PoC by Eugene Lim\r\n\r\npayload.ini\r\n```\r\n[__proto__]\r\npolluted = \"polluted\"\r\n```\r\n\r\npoc.js:\r\n```\r\nvar fs = require('fs')\r\nvar ini = require('ini')\r\n\r\nvar parsed = ini.parse(fs.readFileSync('./payload.ini', 'utf-8'))\r\nconsole.log(parsed)\r\nconsole.log(parsed.__proto__)\r\nconsole.log(polluted)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n> node poc.js\r\n{}\r\n{ polluted: 'polluted' }\r\n{ polluted: 'polluted' }\r\npolluted\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n## For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `ini` to version 1.3.6 or higher.\n# References\n- [Eugene Lim - Research Blog Post](https://medium.com/csg-govtech/supply-chain-pollution-discovering-a-16-million-download-week-node-js-2fa4d2c27cf7)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/npm/ini/commit/56d2805e07ccd94e2ba0984ac9240ff02d44b6f1)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `is-my-json-valid` to version 2.20.2 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mafintosh/is-my-json-valid/commit/c3fc04fc455d40e9b29537f8e2c73a28ce106edb)\n- [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/909757)\n"

The `extend` function can be tricked into modifying the prototype of `Object` when the attacker controls part of the structure passed to this function. This can let an attacker add or modify an existing property that will then exist on all objects.\r\n\r\n**Note:** CVE-2019-5428 is a duplicate of CVE-2019-11358\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n## For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `jquery` to version 3.4.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/753d591aea698e57d6db58c9f722cd0808619b1b)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4333)\n- [Hackerone Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/454365)\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/after-three-years-of-silence-a-new-jquery-prototype-pollution-vulnerability-emerges-once-again/)\n- [Third-Party Backported Patches Repo](https://github.com/DanielRuf/snyk-js-jquery-174006)\n"

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects.

Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.

The parsing of a specially crafted YAML file may exhaust the system resources.\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `js-yaml` to version 3.13.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/commit/a567ef3c6e61eb319f0bfc2671d91061afb01235)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/issues/475)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `lodash` to version 4.17.21 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/c4847ebe7d14540bb28a8b932a9ce1b9ecbfee1a)\n- [GitHub Fix PR](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/pull/5065)\n"

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.

It parses dates using regex strings, which may cause a slowdown of 2 seconds per 50k characters.\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `lodash` to version 4.17.11 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/5c08f18d365b64063bfbfa686cbb97cdd6267347)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/pull/4450)\n- [POC: GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/3359)\n"

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`.

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times).

But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).

An attacker could bypass its output sanitization (`sanitize: true`) protection. Using the [HTML Coded Character Set](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_13.html#SEC13), attackers can inject `javascript:` code snippets into the output. For example, the following input `javascript&#x58document;alert&#40;1&#41;`  will result in `alert(1)` being executed when the user clicks on the link.\n# Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n## Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker.

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one.

This can cause an impact of about 10 seconds matching time for data 150 characters long.\r\n\r\n# Disclosure Timeline\r\n* Feb 21th, 2018 - Initial Disclosure to package owner\r\n* Feb 21th, 2018 - Initial Response from package owner\r\n* Feb 26th, 2018 - Fix issued\r\n* Feb 27th, 2018 - Vulnerability published\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\".

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\n\nUpgrade `minimatch` to version 3.0.2 or higher.\n\n\n# References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/commit/6944abf9e0694bd22fd9dad293faa40c2bc8a955)\n"

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.

In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `moment` to version 2.29.2 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5)\n"

The `mongoose.Schema()` function is subject to prototype pollution due to the recursively calling of `Schema.prototype.add()` function to add new items into the schema object. This vulnerability allows modification of the Object prototype.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\n```\r\nmongoose = require('mongoose');\r\nmongoose.version; //'5.12.0'\r\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\":{\"polluted\":\"HACKED\"}}';\r\nconsole.log('Before:', {}.polluted); // undefined\r\nmongoose.Schema(JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\r\nconsole.log('After:', {}.polluted); // HACKED\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path.

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`.

A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2018-16490. In particular, the condition `ignoreProperties.indexOf(parts[i]) !== -1` returns `-1` if `parts[i]` is `['__proto__']`. This is because the method that has been called if the input is an array is `Array.prototype.indexOf()` and not `String.prototype.indexOf()`. They behave differently depending on the type of the input.\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\n```\r\nconst mpath = require('mpath');\r\n// mpath.set(['__proto__', 'polluted'], 'yes', {});\r\n// console.log(polluted); // ReferenceError: polluted is not defined\r\n\r\nmpath.set([['__proto__'], 'polluted'], 'yes', {});\r\nconsole.log(polluted); // yes\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n## For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `nconf` to version 0.11.4 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/pull/397)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/releases/tag/v0.11.4)\n"

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n## Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n## Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `parse-url` to version 6.0.1 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ionicabizau/parse-url/commit/21c72ab9412228eea753e2abc48f8962707b1fe3)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/parse-url/pull/37)\n"

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n## Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n## Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `parse-url` to version 6.0.1 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ionicabizau/parse-url/commit/21c72ab9412228eea753e2abc48f8962707b1fe3)\n"

Poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nWhile the 8.0.0 release has completely eliminated the vulnerable functionality, prior versions that have received the patch to mitigate backtracking may still be vulnerable if custom regular expressions are used. So it is strongly recommended for regular expression input to be controlled to avoid malicious performance degradation in those versions. This behavior is enforced as of version 7.1.0 via the `strict` option, which returns an error if a dangerous regular expression is detected.\r\n\r\n# Workaround\r\nThis vulnerability can be avoided by using a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a segment, which excludes `-` and `/`.\n# PoC\n```js\r\n/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `path-to-regexp` to version 0.1.10, 1.9.0, 3.3.0, 6.3.0, 8.0.0 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/29b96b4a1de52824e1ca0f49a701183cc4ed476f)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/60f2121e9b66b7b622cc01080df0aabda9eedee6)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/f73ec6c86b06f544b977119c2b62a16de480a6a9)\n- [Strict Mode Release Note](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0)\n- [Vulnerability Write-up](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)\n"

Poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThis issue is caused due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2024-45296](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PATHTOREGEXP-7925106).\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by avoiding using two parameters within a single path segment, when the separator is not `.` (e.g. no `/:a-:b`). Alternatively, the regex used for both parameters can be defined to ensure they do not overlap to allow backtracking.\n# PoC\n```js\r\n/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `path-to-regexp` to version 0.1.12 or higher.\n# References\n- [Blog Post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/f01c26a013b1889f0c217c643964513acf17f6a4)\n"

By default `qs` protects against attacks that attempt to overwrite an object's existing prototype properties, such as `toString()`, `hasOwnProperty()`,etc.\r\n\r\nFrom [`qs` documentation](https://github.com/ljharb/qs):\r\n> By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use plainObjects as mentioned above, or set allowPrototypes to true which will allow user input to overwrite those properties.

The semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack.\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users.

Due to an issue with the manner in which the objects are initialized, an attacker can expose or modify a limited amount of property information on those objects. There is no impact to availability.\n# PoC\n```\r\n// PoC.js\r\nasync function main(){\r\nvar tough = require(\"tough-cookie\");\r\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar(undefined,{rejectPublicSuffixes:false});\r\n// Exploit cookie\r\nawait cookiejar.setCookie(\r\n  \"Slonser=polluted; Domain=__proto__; Path=/notauth\",\r\n  \"https://__proto__/admin\"\r\n);\r\n// normal cookie\r\nvar cookie = await cookiejar.setCookie(\r\n  \"Auth=Lol; Domain=google.com; Path=/notauth\",\r\n  \"https://google.com/\"\r\n);\r\n\r\n//Exploit cookie\r\nvar a = {};\r\nconsole.log(a[\"/notauth\"][\"Slonser\"])\r\n}\r\nmain();\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n# Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n# How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n## For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `tough-cookie` to version 4.1.3 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `uglify-js` to version 3.14.3 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/commit/157521066fc43cff2feab7ffc1ecea603617606b)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/5133)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/pull/5134)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/pull/5135)\n"

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n## Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n## Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n# Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`.

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nUpgrade `brace-expansion` to version 1.1.7 or higher.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion/pull/35)\r\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion/issues/33)\r\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion/pull/35/commits/b13381281cead487cbdbfd6a69fb097ea5e456c3)"

These allow an attacker to overwrite files they typically cannot access, but that are accessible by the user running the CLI-using app. This is possible since the `/tmp/` folder is (typically) writeable to all system users, and because the names of the files in question are easily predicted by an attacker.\r\n\r\nNote that while this is a real vulnerability, it relies on functionality (`daemon` mode) which is only supported in very old Node versions (0.8 or older), and so is unlikely to be used by most `cli` users. To avoid any doubt, the fixed version (1.0.0) removes support for this feature entirely.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has also been assigned CVE-2016-1000021.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nFor example, assume user _victim_ occasionally runs a CLI tool called `cli-tool`, which uses the `cli` package.\r\nIf an attacker gains write access to the `/tmp/` folder of that machine (but not the higher permissions _victim_ has), they can create the symbolic link `/tmp/cli-tool.pid -> /home/victim/important-file`. When _victim_ runs `cli-tool`, the `important-file` in victim's root directory will be nullified. If the CLI tool is run as root, the same can be done to nullify `/etc/passwd` and make the system unbootable. \r\n\r\nNote that popular CLI tools have no reason to mask their names, and so attackers can easily guess a long list of tools victims may run by checking the `cli` package [dependents](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/cli).\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nUpgrade `cli` to version `1.0.0` or greater, which disables the affected feature.\r\n\r\nFrom the fix release notes:\r\n```\r\nThis feature relies on a beta release (e.g. version 0.5.1) of a Node.js\r\nmodule on npm--one that was superseded by a stable (e.g. version 1.0)\r\nrelease published three years ago [2]. Due to a build-time dependency on\r\nthe long-since deprecated `node-waf` tool, the module at that version\r\ncan only be built for Node.js versions 0.8 and below.\r\n\r\nGiven this, actual usage of this feature is likely very limited. Remove\r\nit completely so the integrity of this module's core functionality can\r\nbe verified.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# References\r\n[1] https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=809252\r\n[2] https://github.com/node-js-libs/cli/commit/fd6bc4d2a901aabe0bb6067fbcc14a4fe3faa8b9"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `debug` to version 2.6.9, 3.1.0, 3.2.7, 4.3.1 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/debug-js/debug/commit/b6d12fdbc63b483e5c969da33ea6adc09946b5ac)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/pull/504/commits/42a6ae0737f9243c80b6d3dbb08a69a7ae2a1061)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/501)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/pull/504)\n- [GitHub Release Notes 2.6.9](https://github.com/debug-js/debug/releases/tag/2.6.9)\n- [GitHub Release Notes 3.1.0](https://github.com/debug-js/debug/releases/tag/3.1.0)\n"

If an attacker can control part of the structure passed to this function, they could add or modify an existing property.  \r\n\r\n# PoC by Olivier Arteau (HoLyVieR)\r\n```js\r\nvar Hoek = require('hoek');\r\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\":{\"oops\":\"It works !\"}}';\r\n\r\nvar a = {};\r\nconsole.log(\"Before : \" + a.oops);\r\nHoek.merge({}, JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\r\nconsole.log(\"After : \" + a.oops);\r\n\r\n```\n\n# Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `hoek` to version 4.2.1, 5.0.3 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/commit/32ed5c9413321fbc37da5ca81a7cbab693786dee)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/commit/5aed1a8c4a3d55722d1c799f2368857bf418d6df)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/issues/230)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/hapijs/hoek/pull/227)\n- [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/310439)\n- [NPM Security Advisory](http://npmjs.com/advisories/566)\n"

The fix limited the length of accepted input string to 10,000 characters, and turned to be insufficient making it possible to block the event loop for 0.3 seconds (on a typical laptop) with a specially crafted string passed to `ms()` function.\r\n\r\n*Proof of concept*\r\n```js\r\nms = require('ms');\r\nms('1'.repeat(9998) + 'Q') // Takes about ~0.3s\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Snyk's patch for this vulnerability limits input length to 100 characters. This new limit was deemed to be a breaking change by the author.\r\nBased on user feedback, we believe the risk of breakage is _very_ low, while the value to your security is much greater, and therefore opted to still capture this change in a patch for earlier versions as well.  Whenever patching security issues, we always suggest to run tests on your code to validate that nothing has been broken.\r\n\r\nFor more information on `Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)` attacks, go to our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking/).\r\n\r\n# Disclosure Timeline\r\n- Feb 9th, 2017 - Reported the issue to package owner.\r\n- Feb 11th, 2017 - Issue acknowledged by package owner.\r\n- April 12th, 2017 - Fix PR opened by Snyk Security Team.\r\n- May 15th, 2017 - Vulnerability published.\r\n- May 16th, 2017 - Issue fixed and version `2.0.0` released.\r\n- May 21th, 2017 - Patches released for versions `>=0.7.1, <=1.0.0`.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r\n```js\r\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\r\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r\n\r\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r\n\r\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r\n\r\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r\n1. CCC\r\n2. CC+C\r\n3. C+CC\r\n4. C+C+C.\r\n\r\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r\n\r\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\r\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\r\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nUpgrade `ms` to version 2.0.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/zeit/ms/pull/89)\r\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/zeit/ms/pull/89/commits/305f2ddcd4eff7cc7c518aca6bb2b2d2daad8fef)"

Literal dots in a path were resolved out, but url encoded dots were not. Thus, a request like ``` /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd ``` would leak sensitive files and data from the server.\r\n\r\nAs of version 0.2.5, any ```'/../'``` in the request path, urlencoded or not, will be replaced with ```'/'```. If your application depends on url traversal, then you are encouraged to please refactor so that you do not depend on having ```..``` in url paths, as this tends to expose data that you may be surprised to be exposing.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r\n\r\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r\n\r\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r\n\r\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n```\r\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r\n\r\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nUpgrade to version 0.2.5 or greater.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- https://github.com/isaacs/st#security-status\r\n- http://blog.npmjs.org/post/80277229932/newly-paranoid-maintainers"

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure. \r\n\r\nA possible memory disclosure vulnerability exists when a value of type `number` is used to set the _proxy.auth_ option of a request `request` and results in a possible uninitialized memory exposures in the request body.\r\n\r\nThis is a result of unobstructed use of the `Buffer` constructor, whose [insecure default constructor increases the odds of memory leakage](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of length `N` with raw (not \"zero-ed\") memory.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the first call would allocate 100 bytes of memory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed for the string \"100\":\r\n```js\r\n// uninitialized Buffer of length 100\r\nx = new Buffer(100);\r\n// initialized Buffer with value of '100'\r\nx = new Buffer('100');\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tunnel-agent`'s `request` construction uses the default `Buffer` constructor as-is, making it easy to append uninitialized memory to an existing list. If the value of the buffer list is exposed to users, it may expose raw server side memory, potentially holding secrets, private data and code. This is a similar vulnerability to the infamous [`Heartbleed`](http://heartbleed.com/) flaw in OpenSSL.\r\n\r\n### Proof of concept by ChALkeR\r\n```js\r\nrequire('request')({\r\n  method: 'GET',\r\n  uri: 'http://www.example.com',\r\n  tunnel: true,\r\n  proxy:{\r\n      protocol: 'http:',\r\n      host:\"127.0.0.1\",\r\n      port:8080,\r\n      auth:80\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the insecure `Buffer` behavior [on our blog](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\r\n\r\nSimilar vulnerabilities were discovered in [request](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:request:20160119), [mongoose](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:mongoose:20160116), [ws](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20160104) and [sequelize](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:sequelize:20160115).\r\n\r\n# Remediation\r\nUpgrade `tunnel-agent` to version 0.6.0 or higher.\r\n**Note** This is vulnerable only for Node <=4\n\n# References\n- [https://github.com/request/tunnel-agent/commit/9ca95ec7219daface8a6fc2674000653de0922c0](https://github.com/request/tunnel-agent/commit/9ca95ec7219daface8a6fc2674000653de0922c0)\n- [https://gist.github.com/ChALkeR/fd6b2c445834244e7d440a043f9d2ff4](https://gist.github.com/ChALkeR/fd6b2c445834244e7d440a043f9d2ff4)\n"
